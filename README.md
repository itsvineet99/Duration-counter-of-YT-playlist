# Duration-counter-of-YT-playlist

This is python programme which uses youtube api to measure duration of playlist.
it takes username and name of playlist as input and gives you total duration of playlist.
note: some youtube channels don't provide correct username of their channel(channel name != username) in this case you can copy playlist id from url(in url a string of letters and numbers after list= ) and paste it when programme asks.
